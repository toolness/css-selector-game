    <H1>Morning task</H1>
    <p>Morning task today was easy-easy so i decided to play a little bit with git and terminal</p>
    <p>I made fork, cloned repo from morning task link, created vrbrlop branch,
        after that i created new file "homework" using touch command, and added a few lines of code. using H1 and p tags.
        For more job I need more knowlage about css and html.
    </p>
    <p>for sure i will try to push to repo and merge branches</p>
